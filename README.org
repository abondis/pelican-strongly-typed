*** pelican-strongly-typed
    Theme based on html5up-strongly-typed desing.
    - pip install pyjade
    - add to pelicanconf.py
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      JINJA_EXTENSIONS = (['pyjade.ext.jinja.PyJadeExtension'])
      #+END_SRC
    - run ./prepare_html.sh

    There seems to be an issue with using jade files directly when running 'pelican'.
    So for now we have to prepare the html files by hand using pyjade
